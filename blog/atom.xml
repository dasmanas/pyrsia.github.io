        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain technologies are trending. There’s a lot of information about what they do and how they work but often these are abstract high level overviews. Looking beneath the surface, these overviews skip some of the most fascinating parts of the implementations that bring these technologies to life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-blockchain">What is a Blockchain?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-a-blockchain" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>IBM has one of my <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">favorite definitions</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets <!-- -->[<!-- -->... on] a network.
An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually
anything of value can be tracked <!-- -->[<!-- -->... ] on a blockchain network, reducing risk <!-- -->[<!-- -->...] for all involved. </p></blockquote><p>There’s a few key items to highlight from this definition are:</p><ul><li>A shared, immutable ledger</li><li>Recording and tracking assets</li></ul><p>Simply put, a Blockchain is a list of changes to assets, called transactions, which are grouped in blocks that are recognized by all participants in the network.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, it leaves out one major element. How do blockchain networks reduce risk? How do blockchain networks agree on the shared ledger?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consensus">Consensus<a class="hash-link" href="#consensus" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In the world of blockchain, consensus is the agreement of which block is next. Collectively all the participants in the blockchain’s network
should come to the same conclusion.</p><p>You’ve probably heard of “Proof of Work”, usually called mining, and “Proof of Stake”, these two are the most popular in terms of market share
in the crypto markets.</p><p>These consensus algorithms were some of the first to be popularized by projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These are far from the only ones, Proof of Authority, Proof of Burn, Proof of Capacity and Proof of History are just from others mentioned on <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investopedia's Website</a>.</p><p>Let’s dive deeper into the two popular algorithms to see how they obtain consensus.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proof-of-work">Proof of Work<a class="hash-link" href="#proof-of-work" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Proof of Work is based on a mathematical expression which is very costly to compute a magic number, called a nonce, but easily verified. Each participant, typically referred to as a miner, begins the calculation with the transitions it’s heard on the network since the last published block. Participants race each other to find the right answer and the winner traditionally gets a reward. It’s difficult to cheat and very rewarding to operate in good faith.</p><p>At the time of writing, January 28th 2022, the reward is 6.25 BTC which is worth 236,755 USD. It’s easy to draw parallels to the 1849 Gold Rush.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lbGxZlJRF5GlNLNmbQlnS7Rdk0CHU9w2QjyfghfFLKWOa-bz7ZaEq83AWwVwEd4oJXZgUhyBQxzZ_-_6ytuISeQXU1er77nfwYpdoPgaE_8bvQqKFdsLmUVRbuc9NrePRDTtcZ7YbkqgTq5RMg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>When miners hear of a new block, they immediately stop their calculation and begin listening for more transactions. This is approximately a 10 minute window for Bitcoin.</p><p>With a small number of competitors it’s pretty straightforward but when tens of thousands of nodes are involved, what happens if two miners finish at the same time. Who wins?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proof-of-stake">Proof of Stake&nbsp;<a class="hash-link" href="#proof-of-stake" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Proof of Stake is an investment strategy where committing more capital means you’re more likely to get the reward. <a href="https://www.peercoin.net/whitepapers/peercoin-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peercoin</a>, a very early PoS implementation, kept the mining of PoW but required less computational complexity the more <em>coinage</em> was staked. If two participants offer the same investment in the next block, which one is rewarded?</p><p>If someone is able to offer more capital for their block to be accepted, are they able to always win? Yes, this is a special type of security exploit called a 51% attack. If the confirmation of the next block is tied to a resource, then an entity which holds a majority stake can take control of the blockchain. Proof of Work is also susceptible to this type of attack.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stale-and-orphan-blocks">Stale and Orphan Blocks<a class="hash-link" href="#stale-and-orphan-blocks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Most blockchain’s are actually trees, not linked lists which is what probably comes to mind for young data scientists. This probably comes as a shock but it’s the secret ingredient to solving our racing condition when two participants propose the next block in PoW.</p><blockquote><p>If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer.
The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes longer.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System Section 5</em></a></p><p>Chains are made of links that connect to others.
