The idea is to improve upon the Kademila peer selection process and make "smarter" choices from Pyrsia peers based on a "peer metric". The mechanism is layered atop the Kademila peer selection process, which in Pyrisa returns a list of peers known to be in possession of an open-source distribution of interest. The peer metric is a real time assessment of the work-load of any given machine in the network, both related and unrelated to any current software transfers within the Pyrsia network.

"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The primary rule defined by our selection process is that requesters must not overwhelm peers by requesting too many software distributions too often from any one neighboring node. Though hard resource usage limits are a configuration function for Pyrsia Peers, Pyrsia\u2019s peer selection mechanism should also attempt to balance requests across the network of peers. Additionally, the peer selection mechanism should operate such that file requesters are not starved for bandwidth in the network by unresponsive peers, preventing fast downloads.

The means of describing these terms can be defined as a function of the attributes within the environment. There are measurable attributes of both the network and the Pyrsia peers participating in the networks that can help us define metrics to balance requests. These metrics will ultimately determine the quality of peers in the requesters' peer list. The term quality in this context is related to the ability of a peer to satisfy a request for download and will be defined by the function Q(x):"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"$Q(x) = \\sum_{n=1} ^{pa\\ count} pa_n * weight$"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"where ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"pa")," is a peer attribute of the environment and ",(0,o.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"weight")," is a number that determines the expense of the attribute.

The quality function can be used for either upload quality or download quality depending on the need. The metric is currently used during the selection process for downloading software distributions.
